**Pet-finder - VGG-16 network for calculating populatiry score**

The model predicts the popularity score of an image. I have used pre-trained computer vision technique to train my model. I have used Google AI cloud to train my model. 

Steps are mentioned below:

1. Created directories and sub-directories for storing training and validation images. 
2. Divided the dataset into training and validation set and stored in respective folder. 
3. Resized the images to speed up the training. 
4. Used convolution based on the VGG-16 and added dense layer and trained with 10 epochs. 
5. Results are calculated.
